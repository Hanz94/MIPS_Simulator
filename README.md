# MIPS_Simulator

In this  project  you  will  create  a  simple  MIPS  simulatorwhich  will  perform  the  following  two  tasks. 

* Loada  specified  MIPS  text  file and  generatethe  assembly  code  equivalent to  the  input  file (disassembler). Please see the sample input file and disassembly output.
* Generatethe instruction-by-instruction  simulation of  the  MIPS  code(simulator).It  will output the contents  of registersand data  memories after  execution  of  each  instruction. Please see the sample simulation output file.

### How to Run

`python3 MIPSSim.py sample.txt`

It will produce two output files `simulation.txt` and `disassemble.txt`
